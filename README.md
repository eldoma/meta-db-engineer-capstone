Meta Database Engineering Capstone Project: Database system for fictional Little Lemon Restaurant

## Scenario Setup 
Little Lemon restaurant requires an update to their booking systems. There are several aspects that need to be considered when engaging with this project including:

- Maintaining consistency when updating code.

- Ensuring there are sufficient structures in place to save, alter and query data. 

- Ensuring there is a mechanism for displaying the data in a manner that is easily interpretable. 

- Checking that there is a front-end system for accessing and updating the data.
